# Employee Management API

The Employee Management API is a RESTful service designed to handle CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on employee data. It provides endpoints to interact with employee information and includes security features for both authentication and authorization.

## Functionality

The API allows users to perform the following operations on employee data:

- Retrieve a list of all employees
- Retrieve details of a specific employee by ID
- Add a new employee to the system
- Update existing employee information
- Delete an employee from the system

## Endpoints

The following endpoints are available:

- `GET /api/employees`: Retrieves a list of all employees.
- `GET /api/employees/{employeeId}`: Retrieves details of a specific employee identified by `employeeId`.
- `POST /api/employees`: Adds a new employee to the system.
- `PUT /api/employees`: Updates an existing employee.
- `DELETE /api/employees/{employeeId}`: Deletes an employee identified by `employeeId`.

## Security

### Authentication

The API implements authentication to ensure that only authenticated users can access the endpoints. This is typically achieved using mechanisms like JSON Web Tokens (JWT), OAuth, or basic authentication.

### Authorization

Authorization mechanisms are implemented to control access to specific endpoints based on user roles or permissions. This ensures that users can only perform actions they are authorized to do. For example, only administrators might have permission to add or delete employees, while regular users can only view or update employee information.

## Technologies Used

- Java
- Spring Boot
- Spring Security (for authentication and authorization)
- Maven (for dependency management)
